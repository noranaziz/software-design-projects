// COMMENT: Overall good solution. Just improve your coding and comment
// style (i.e, fix your code smells).
// RESPONSE: I fixed the solution further to work with parenthesis.
// Code has been made cleaner and more comments have been added in 
// Calculator.cpp to outline how the code works.


// main
int main()
{
    // calculator
    Calculator calc;
    calc.calculate();
}
